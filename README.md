# MODIS_swath-regrid

Code for computing DOD from MODIS AOD, Angstom exponent and single scattering albedo from swath data (level 2), in analogy to Pu and Ginoux (2018).
Regridding from swath to custom grid using normalised nearest_d2s. 

This code can be run as is on the JASMIN HPC system.
Remember to update paths and SLURM settings before submissing jobs.
